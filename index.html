      <p>Hello!</p>
      <p>My name is Momena Masood and I love creativity, communication and inspiring challenges. I'm 20 years old and studying Information Technology at York University. Actually, I come from another city - Lahore, where I lived for 19 years with my family, but one year ago, I moved to Toronto for my undergraduate studies. I am fond of doing photography in my spare time and have even documented many events as my personal favourite hobby. I am deeply passionate about computer programming and web designing. I appreciate working together with others, aesthetically through photography and definitely, through mentorship. I look forward to continuing to develop these skills and passions through this opportunity.</p>

      <p>I am a tireless seeker of knowledge, occasional purveyor of philosophy and also, coincidentally an amateur Web developer. Driven and permanently curious, I am now specializing in Full-stack Web Development. </p>
